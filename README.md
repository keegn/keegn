### Hi, Iâ€™m Keegan

Iâ€™m a front-end software engineer living in Northern New Mexico. I'm currently building software to help folks pay for medical expenses over time, interest free at [Paytient](https://github.com/paytient). 

In my free time, I like to [ride my gravel bike](https://www.strava.com/athletes/16025620). ðŸ‘‹
